                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <p>The site I chose to test is
                        <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic Kids</a> website. I chose
                        this website mainly because the test subjects I had access to were kids. I wanted to find a site
                        that would be somthing that would interest them.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Test</h2>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the test was to see if a school age child could navigate the website on their own
                        without the help of an adult. Each child was asked what they first noticed about the site and
                        what they thought the site was used for. Then each child was asked to complete three tasks. The
                        First task was to find information about Geckos. The second task was to find the action game
                        "Just Joking: funny or not". The third task was to explore the Us State Florida. This is the
                        same test that I did for the full website. The results were the same for most of the tasks that
                        the children were asked to do on the mobile site as they were on the full site.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Results</h2>

                    <p>Each child notcied all the different things they could do on the site. The first things noticed
                        was the video and all the pictures of animals. this was different from the full site becaue the
                        tabs were not visable on the mobile site like they were on the full site. </p>

                    <p>Each child speculated that the site was for learning about nature and animals.</p>

                    <p> For the first task there was one path that was followed to find information about
                        Geckos. The path they followed was to touch the menu, scroll down to animals, touch reptiles,
                        scroll to geckos, and touch geckos to find the information about geckos.</p>

                    <img src="img/mobile_animals.png" width="150" height="250" style="padding:20px;">
                    <img src="img/mobile_gecko.png" width="150" height="250" style="padding:20px;">
                    <img src="img/mobile_gecko_info.png" width="150" height="250" style="padding:20px;">

                    <p>For the second task each child followed the same path like they did for the first task. The path
                        they followed was to touch menu,
                        touch action in the games section and then scroll down until they found the game "Just
                        joking:funny or
                        not".</p>

                    <img src="img/mobile_just_joking.png" width="150" height="250" style="padding:20px;">

                    <p>For the third task each child followed the same path like they did for the first and second task.
                        The path
                        they followed was touch the menu, scroll to the explore extion and touch U.S. States and then
                        they scrolled down
                        to Florida.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>This site is very well done. The children didn't have any issues completing the tasks they were
                        asked to complete. Since none of the children chose to find the items asked for by using the
                        search tool like they did for the full site I decided to give it a try to see what would happen.
                        It did the same thing as it did for the full site by opening a new tab each time somthing was
                        selected. I would make the same suggetion that they make the search results inclusive to the
                        site and not open new tabs everytime something is selected.
                    </p>
